# NodeCopterTrack-Land

Program a commercial ArDrone 2.0 to autonomously track and land on an object. This is being programmed with the ArDrone Node.js,
as well as the OpenCV bindings for Node.js.

Steps:

1. Control quadcopter with Node.js through keyboard presses [DONE]
2. Track colored object and find central coordinates using OpenCV bindings [DONE]
3. ArDrone autonomously track and follow colored object from constant height [IN PROGRESS]
4. Apply PID controls to ArDrone to smoothen movements [NO]
5. Autonmously land ArDrone on colored object [NO]
